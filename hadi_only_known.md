# Had I only known ${x} a year ago...

## First year

### Buying

First and foremost: Don't! I know it's hard, there's so many things out there telling you they are must-haves. Most likely they weren't available when you were raised, nor when your parents or grand-parents grew up. It's highly unlikely you need them. other stuff


### Reading

First and foremost: Don't. Especially not if you are used to clear, precise technical literature. What's being sold as good advise books when it comes to raising humans has pretty much the same breadth of ideas - if not more - behind it like what's being sold on the topic of managing projects and teams. What's more, there's a way bigger audience for these books, so there's way more crap out there.

### Discussing

As with any bike-shedding topic: Don't feed the trolls. It drains your energy. Ask open ended questions (something along the lines of "which type of travel works best for your family in summer?") if you really need to. But do avoid getting into arguments about anything "child": In contrast to tech topics where often there truly is a right or wrong answer, there's plenty of opinions when it comes to raising little human beings. The problem isn't getting any easier when looking at research: We aren't talking physics where experiments can be repeated in isolation. We are talking fuzzy, more often than should be scientifically unclean procedures. What usually helps: Listen to others and their experiences, adopt what works for your family, toss everything else. And remember that everyone else has to make the same adjustments. So what works for your, most likely won't work for anyone else - at least not verbatim.

Parting advise: Don't trust parent's accounts of how they solved ${X} or how ${Y} turned out to be ever. Everyone is lying - either knowingly, e.g. to not give away doing things different than the perceived main stream - or unknowingly due to false recollection.

It's a bit like tech conferences:  Young attendees tend to be so frustrated because all those speakers seem to be having no technical debt, no process issues, no legacy code at all - while most likely talks simply focused mostly on the beautiful stuff and leave the less glorious topics out.
